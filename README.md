# Fake-News-Prediction
In this project, we aimed to address the problem of fake news detection using machine learning techniques. Our goal was to build a model that could accurately classify news articles as either real or fake. To do this, we obtained a dataset of news articles and their labels from the Kaggle platform.

We preprocessed the text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming and tokenization. These techniques helped to standardize the text data and make it more amenable to analysis. We implemented our model in Python, making use of libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to assist with data processing and model building.

To train our model, we applied classification algorithms such as logistic regression. Our model achieved impressive results, with a precision of 98.08% on the test set and 99.29% on the training set, as well as an accuracy of 98.73% on the training set and 97.74% on the test set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using classification and NLP in the task of fake news detection.
